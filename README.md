# Caprover Compose Action

This Github Action allows the deployment of multiple apps directly from Github by utilizing the official Caprover CLI.
As Caprover doesn't support docker-compose stil([link](https://caprover.com/docs/docker-compose.html)), this action introduces custom logic for multiple application deployment. By the way, you have to translate the docker-compose into the format which this action can understand.

- First, in the compose context dir(configurable by `context` parameter), create one directory per one application. Directory name is used as the application name.
- In each application folder, create a `captain_definition` file. This will be used for application deployment.
- Also in the same folder, you can create `json` or `yml` files to configure the application. The file format should follow Caprover configuration file for consuming Caprover API([link](https://github.com/caprover/caprover-cli/tree/master#api)). These files are applied to the application in the order of their names using `caprover api` command.
Note: If Caprover configuration file includes application name, please use `$APP` as application name because a unique application name is generated per a pull request.
For example, this is a Caprover configuration file to enable SSL.
```json
{
  "path": "/user/apps/appDefinitions/enablebasedomainssl",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": {
    "appName": "$APP"
  }
}
```

## Example compose context
Here is the example directory structure of a system consisting of multiple microservices.
```txt
.caprover
|_ frontend
|  |_captain_definition
|  |_01_enable_ssl.json
|  |_02_map_port.yml
|  |_...
|  |_99_output.json
|_ auth_api
|_ stock_api
|_ ...
|_ rabbitmq
|_ ...
|_ postgresql

```
Example `captain_definition` file;
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "imageName": "nginxdemos/hello"
}
```
Example configuration file `01_enable_ssl.json`;
```json
{
  "path": "/user/apps/appDefinitions/enablebasedomainssl",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": {
    "appName": "ci-frontend"
  }
}
```

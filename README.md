# Caprover Compose Action
<img src="https://caprover.com/img/logo.png" alt="image" width="100" height="auto">

This Github Action allows the deployment of multiple apps directly from Github by utilizing the official [Caprover](https://caprover.com/) CLI.
As Caprover doesn't support docker-compose stil([link](https://caprover.com/docs/docker-compose.html)), this action introduces custom logic for multiple application deployment. By the way, you have to translate the docker-compose into the format which this action can understand.

- First, in the compose context dir(configurable by `context` parameter), create one directory per one application. Directory name is used as the application alias name.
- In each application folder, create a `captain_definition` file. This will be used for application deployment.
- In each application folder, you can also create `json` or `yml` files to configure the application. The file format should follow Caprover configuration file for consuming Caprover API([link](https://github.com/caprover/caprover-cli/tree/master#api)). These files are applied to the application in the order of their names using `caprover api` command.
Note: If Caprover configuration file includes application name, please use `$$APP` as application name because a unique application name is generated per a pull request.
For example, this is a Caprover configuration file to enable SSL.
```json
# 01_enable_ssl.json
{
  "path": "/user/apps/appDefinitions/enablebasedomainssl",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": {
    "appName": "$$APP"
  }
}
```
- In each application folder, you can also create `.env` file to set environment variables for the app.
In multi-layer applications, a caprover application needs to communicate with other caprover application and the connection information is configured in `.env` file. Typical use case is a database connection. 
The name of each container is prefixed with `srv-captain--` so you can set `srv-captain--$$PREFIX-db`. `db` is the app directory(app alias) name of db application in the context directory. `$$PREFIX` will be replaced by caprover compose action with the exact app name prefix.

```txt
# .env
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=mariadb+mariadbconnector://user:password@srv-captain--$$PREFIX-db:3306/infrahubdb
...
```

## Action parameters
### Input
This Github Action requires the following parameters;

- server

  Captain server url. For example, https://captain.your-domain.com.

- password

  Captain password.

- context

  The path of definition and configuration files of applications. Optional. Default: `.caprover/`

- prefix

  Prefix of Caprover app names. The app name is `${prefix}-${app_directory_name}`. `app_directory_name` is the directory name in the context path(`.caprover/`). Optional.
  Default value is
    - when the event type is `pull_reuqest`, `pr${repo_alias}-${EVENT_ID}`.
    - For other event types, `br${repo_alias}-${EVENT_ID}`.
  `repo_alias` is `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID` in Github action. In Gitea act, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID` is `null` so a 6-length hash value generated from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is used.

- keep

  It specifies whether to keep or remove the Caprover applicationswhen the workflow is finished. Optional. Default: `true`

### Output
This Github Action outputs the urls of Caprover applications.
Output parameter name is equal to application aliases.

Example usage;
```yaml
name: Container image

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout project
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy caprover
        uses: josedev-union/caprover-compose-action@main
        with:
          server: https://captain.your-domain.com

      - name: Output App urls as git comment
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          script: |
            const output = `#### Caprover Front App url ðŸ–Œ ${{ steps.caprover.outputs.frontend }}`;

            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: output
            })
```

## Example compose context
Here is the example directory structure of a system consisting of multiple microservices.
```txt
.caprover
|_ frontend
|  |_captain_definition
|  |_01_enable_ssl.json
|  |_02_map_port.yml
|  |_...
|  |_99_output.json
|_ auth_api
|_ stock_api
|_ ...
|_ rabbitmq
|_ ...
|_ postgresql

```
Example `captain_definition` file;
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "imageName": "nginxdemos/hello"
}
```
Example configuration file `01_enable_ssl.json`;
```json
{
  "path": "/user/apps/appDefinitions/enablebasedomainssl",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": {
    "appName": "ci-frontend"
  }
}
```

## Caprover Application name
Caprover deploys applications on Docker and container names are based on application names. So it requires application names to be unique. To make sure the application names are unique across all git repositories, this action generates application names as following;
`${PREFIX}-${REPOSITORY_ID}-${EVENT_ID}-${APP_ALIAS_NAME}`.
- `PREFIX`: `prefix` action parameter
- `REPOSITORY_ID`: Git repository unique id
- `EVENT_ID`: Git event unique id. It varies depending on even types
  - Pull requests: pull request number
  - Push: branch name
  - Tag: tag
- `APP_ALIAS_NAME`: dir name for an application in `context` path

For example, `pr-715000497-2-frontend`

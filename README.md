# Caprover Compose Action

This Github Action allows the deployment of multiple apps directly from Github by utilizing the official Caprover CLI.
As Caprover doesn't support docker-compose stil([link](https://caprover.com/docs/docker-compose.html)), this action introduces custom logic for multiple application deployment. By the way, you have to translate the docker-compose into the format which this action can understand.

- First, in the compose context dir(configurable by `context` parameter), create one directory per one application. Directory name is used as the application name.
- In each application folder, create a `captain_definition` file. This will be used for application deployment.
- In each application folder, you can also create `json` or `yml` files to configure the application. The file format should follow Caprover configuration file for consuming Caprover API([link](https://github.com/caprover/caprover-cli/tree/master#api)). These files are applied to the application in the order of their names using `caprover api` command.
Note: If Caprover configuration file includes application name, please use `$APP` as application name because a unique application name is generated per a pull request.
For example, this is a Caprover configuration file to enable SSL.
```json
# 01_enable_ssl.json
{
  "path": "/user/apps/appDefinitions/enablebasedomainssl",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": {
    "appName": "$APP"
  }
}
```
- In each application folder, you can also create `.env` file to set environment variables for the app.
```txt
# .env
KEY1=VALUE1
KEY2=VALUE2
...
```

## Action parameters
This Github Action requires the following parameters;
- server

  Captain server url. For example, https://captain.your-domain.com.
- password

  Captain password.
- context

  The path of definition and configuration files of applications. Optional. Default: `.caprover/`
- prefix

  Prefix of Caprover app names. Optional. Default: `pr`
- keep

  It specifies whether to keep or remove the Caprover applicationswhen the workflow is finished. Optional. Default: `true`

Example usage;
```yaml
name: Container image

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout project
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy caprover
        uses: josedev-union/caprover-compose-action@main
        with:
          server: https://captain.your-domain.com
```

## Example compose context
Here is the example directory structure of a system consisting of multiple microservices.
```txt
.caprover
|_ frontend
|  |_captain_definition
|  |_01_enable_ssl.json
|  |_02_map_port.yml
|  |_...
|  |_99_output.json
|_ auth_api
|_ stock_api
|_ ...
|_ rabbitmq
|_ ...
|_ postgresql

```
Example `captain_definition` file;
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "imageName": "nginxdemos/hello"
}
```
Example configuration file `01_enable_ssl.json`;
```json
{
  "path": "/user/apps/appDefinitions/enablebasedomainssl",
  "method": "POST",
  "data": {
    "appName": "ci-frontend"
  }
}
```

## Caprover Application name
Caprover deploys applications on Docker and container names are based on application names. So it requires application names to be unique. To make sure the application names are unique across all git repositories, this action generates application names as following;
`${PREFIX}-${REPOSITORY_ID}-${EVENT_ID}-${APP_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY_NAME}`.
- `PREFIX`: `prefix` action parameter
- `REPOSITORY_ID`: Git repository unique id
- `EVENT_ID`: Git event unique id. It varies depending on even types
  - Pull requests: pull request number
  - Push: branch name
  - Tag: tag
- `APP_CONTEXT_DIRECTORY_NAME`: dir name for an application in `context` path

For example, `pr-715000497-2-frontend`
